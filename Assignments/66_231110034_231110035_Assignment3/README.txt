Just run the python script named "asg3_grp66.py"
You will be asked for inputs, enter the x, y and z coordinates one at a time.
The output would be rendered on a window.
And a vtp file named "seed_at_x_y_z.vtp" would be created where x, y, z are replaced wth their corresponding values. 
Keep a note of which directory is open in your IDE(if applicable) while running this script, as the output files would be generted in that directory only.
